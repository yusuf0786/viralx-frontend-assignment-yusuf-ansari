## Setup

You can use VIRALX directly in v0 or deploy it to Vercel. For local development, you can also download the project.

- In v0 (recommended)
  - Open the Preview to run the app instantly.
  - Click Publish (top-right) to deploy to Vercel.
  - Use the GitHub button (top-right) to push the code to your repo.

- Install locally
  - From the Version Box menu in v0, click Download ZIP.
  - Unzip and open the project in your editor.
  - Optionally initialize a Next.js project and copy files, or use the GitHub button in v0 to create a repo you can clone locally.
  - The project is built with the v0 Next.js runtime; when turning it into a standalone Next.js project, ensure Tailwind and shadcn/ui are set up. The v0 UI provides the shadcn CLI to help.
